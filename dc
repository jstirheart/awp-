hey love, we | until we _

  my heart for you
  it still stays,
  faith to glass see us

  love, truth and justice didnt falter
    tho, we feel the splinter within our heart trying to mock us as defeated
      that 45 will persist and hate remains tarnished to toxicity against the lives of the people
      ...against you

      we need to cry
      we want to vet high
      we are inked our actions drenched of your blood and we heal
