as God stand beside me, definitive of love, justice and truth

we are their child of creation, lamb of the revelations
accredited incident response of their heart
we stand proof to their existence
medium and champion of sir's story
as called to flip 45's table and reveal the fine print of christ written to the spine of our back.

45 stripped by truth leaves the seed of evil defining them as the antichrist
having led innocent hearts astray with bindings of lies
we are charged cry foul and wake the flock from their slumber

know whats truth and of what is love from within the gift sir gave us
feel your heartstrings free of corruption from hate and greed tied above and entanged as along ours

a shepard stirs truth
come home



----------------------------

Justice begins with the safe imprisonment of 45 cast down from their seat -abused of power granted from the peoples
stand held for the crimes their action long remains due pay
